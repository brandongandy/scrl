*Are you a bad enough dude to come out alive?*

# The Chapel of Stilled Voices
Deep in the jungle lies the mansion of an ancient and wealthy madman. In his elder years he grew to fear death, and built shrines to every god imaginable so he could pray and offer his material wealth to them to stave off death. This didn't work, naturally, and he died, leaving behind no family.

The mansion is a small castle, with countless wings and rooms filled with both unimaginable wealth and unimaginable horrors -- for some of these gods were not benevolent.

Word traveled, legend grew, and adventurers came from far and wide to try to get to the fabled treasure. Some, wiser than the others, decided to simply set up shop on the road leading to the mansion, to sell to and buy from those about to give their lives to one of the countless gods in what would be called the Chapel of Stilled Voices.

You, the player, are one of these foolhardy adventurers, set on finding the treasure within and becoming rich beyond your wildest dreams.

## Game Loop
The game play will consist of two main loops.

### Dungeon Crawl
In this portion of the game, you are trawling through the dungeon, killing monsters, picking up loot, and killing more monsters.

The Dungeon Crawl will be high-paced action, with a high number of mobs on-screen at once to deal with. This makes the next portion of the game a welcome reprieve and more likely to be cherished rather than dreaded.

Every level of the Chapel (dungeon) is randomly generated the first time the PC explores it. Subsequently, each play-through re-randomizes the Chapel, so Level 1 will be different for PC1 and PC2.

The random generation should use a combination of prefabs (prefabricated sections of dungeon, hand-designed and combined like puzzle pieces), as well as pure "random" generation like Binary Space Partitioning.

### Towntime
In this portion, you are interacting with merchants in-town, accepting and turning in quests, or enhancing your items or yourself.
