# Summary
Religion will play a big role in COSV (working title), mechanically speaking. Because the Chapel is a mish-mash of altars to various gods and spirits, the character's religious affiliation will have an impact on every playthrough.

This page will attempt to list the major religions of the game setting, along with appropriate metadata.

## Alignments
As with many RPG systems, COSV will use a type of alignment system, though (as with other systems in COSV) it will be simplified. Rather than a 3x3 grid of alignment types a la D&D, it will be this:

* Lawful
* Good
* Neutral
* Evil
* Chaotic

These alignments will not affect gameplay choices. They will affect how certain spawned monsters in-game respond to the PC's presence. If the PC happens upon a shrine room to their chosen god, the monsters within may not respond to the player, or perhaps will even interact with and act as special in-dungeon NPCs (one-time shops, like in Fate).

## Aspects
An Aspect is a quality, statement, or goal a character may strive toward, and which a Deity personifies. A Deity may personify multiple aspects, and many Deities with different Alignments may share Aspects among each other. The more Aspects a PC has in common with a given Deity, the more friendly that Deity's followers may act.

Aspects will be defined in a metadata file, but here is a basic list of some.

* "It is a good day to die!"
* Intrepid
* Wisdom
* Desire
* Pleasure
* War
* "No stranger to pain"

## Aesthetics
"Aesthetics" refers to visual aspects of a Deity. A Deity may be dark and broody, or bright and bubbly. This data is mostly meant to be used in room / shrine generation, and will also be contained in a metadata file. Some examples of Aesthetic types are:

* Alien
* Dark
* Colorful
* Strange

## Deities and Demigods
The world of COSV is filled with countless deities, demigods, major and minor spirits, primordial beings, ascendants, etc. From now on they will simply be referred to as Deities.

Each Deity follows one Alignment, embodies up to three Aspects, and holds up to two Aesthetics. Full Deity data will, of course, be held in a metadata file.
