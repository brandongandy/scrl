# SCRL
## A dotnet roguelike

SCRL stands for **SadConsole Roguelike**, since it's built on top of SadConsole and Roguesharp. The original vision for this game was to be an action-oriented roguelike, not unlike the original Diablo -- so much so, in fact, the SCORLIB library was going to be able to read in the exact same flat file format to instantiate game data.

Game development is hard, and game design itself is even harder (if you want to make a good game). SCRL development started sometime in 2017, lasted a few hot months, and then petered off around NaNoWriMo season.
